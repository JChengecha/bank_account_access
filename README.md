Figuring out how we can predict which individuals are most likely to have or use a bank account.
## Project Background
Financial inclusion means that individuals and businesses have access to useful and affordable financial products and services that meet their needs – transactions, payments, savings, credit and insurance – delivered in a responsible and sustainable way.Being able to have access to a transaction account is a first step toward broader financial inclusion since a transaction account allows people to store money, and send and receive payments.
The research problem was to figure out how we can predict which individuals are most likely to have or use a bank account.
This Project is mostly EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) oriented
